## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

FlagX is built primarily with front-end technologies, showcasing what's possible with modern web standards:

*   **HTML5:** Semantic and well-structured markup.
*   **CSS3:**
    *   Advanced styling with CSS Custom Properties (Variables) for theming.
    *   Complex layouts using CSS Grid.
    *   Keyframe animations for dynamic effects.
    *   Responsive design with Media Queries.
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla):**
    *   DOM manipulation for dynamic content and UI updates.
    *   Event handling for all user interactions.
    *   Client-side logic for features like the Dynamic Island, posting, comments, etc.
*   **(Optional but Implied for a Real-World App):**
    *   A backend framework (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django/Flask, Ruby on Rails) would be needed for user authentication, data persistence, and real-time features.
    *   A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL).
